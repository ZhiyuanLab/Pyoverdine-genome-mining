#Files in this folder are used to generate phylogeny tree in Figure 1e
- Phylo_out.csv is used to draw two circles outside the phylogenetic tree. The first circle corresponds to the third column species_color in the table, which lists the color coding of different species. The second circle corresponds to the fourth column lens in the table, which represents the number of modules of NRPS of different strains.
